===========================

Simple Apps Script Code which allows you to publish html/javascript as a web site hosted on google drive.  This is meant to be the simplest blog posting app ever created.  Just copy/paste this code into a new Apps Script file, save a version, deploy as web app, and then after you create a post you will get a link you can send to anyone.  Your post will be published to the public just like any web server except it's hosted on Google Drive.
